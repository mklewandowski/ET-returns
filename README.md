# ET-VCS-reboot
A sequel/reboot/remix of E.T., the 1982 pixel-art adventure classic for the Atari 2600. Inspired by [Vampire Surivors](https://poncle.itch.io/vampire-survivors) and my decades-long dream of building an homage to and reboot of one of my all-time favorite console games (which I believe is unjustly maligned by many lay historians).
